Net-Amazon-EC2-Metadata version 0.10

This module queries Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud Metadata service described at: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2007-08-29/DeveloperGuide/AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html . It also fetches 'user_data' which follows the same API but is often no considered part of the metadata service by Amazons documentation. The module also ships with a command line tool ec2meta  that provides the same data.  

THIS MODULE WILL ONLY WORK ON AN EC2 INSTANCE.
